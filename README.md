# Repomate

**Repomate** is a custom IntelliJ plugin developed to streamline and simplify various development tasks, helping developers work more efficiently within their IDE. Repomate provides an integrated set of tools to automate project setup, manage configurations, and facilitate development workflows.

## Features

1. **Clone Project from Space**  
   Easily clone a project from your designated workspace with a single click. Repomate streamlines the cloning process, reducing setup time and allowing developers to start working on projects quickly.

2. **Auto-Generated Run/Service Configuration**  
   Automatically creates run and service configurations for cloned projects. This feature helps ensure that each project is correctly configured without requiring manual setup.

3. **Composite/Compound Run and Build Buttons**  
   Run and build multiple modules or projects simultaneously using composite or compound buttons. Ideal for large-scale projects, this feature allows you to execute multiple tasks in sequence or parallel without additional configuration.

4. **Framework Cache Clear**  
   Provides a quick and easy way to clear framework caches directly from within IntelliJ, ensuring that projects run smoothly and changes to configurations are reflected immediately.
